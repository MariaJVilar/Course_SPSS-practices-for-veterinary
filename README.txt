The present collection of exercises are designed for an especialization course in the use of SPSS within the frame of veterinary epidemiology.

This is a continuation of the parent course "Introduction to Epidemiology of Foodborne pathogens in Food Hygiene Research" given by Maria J. Vilar at the Department of Food Hygiene and Environmental Health. Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland.

Updated materials (including source codes and solutions) will appear around two weeks before starting a new edition of the course. We used SSPSS 17.0 (current version 24.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

The original course was designed for PhD students of the Dep.of Food Hygiene and Environmental Health. Now we are working on making this course open to anyone with interest in Food Hygiene, Foodborne diseases and Veterinary Epidemiology.
